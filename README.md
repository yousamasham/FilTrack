## 2XB3 Final Project

FilTrack is the solution for finding the perfect music based on userâ€™s mood without spending hours going through the generic playlists. All the user needs to do is select criteria based on their mood (high tempo, liveliness etc.) and FilTrack will filter through the Million Song Database to find the personalized best fit tracks for the user. Success of FilTrack will be determined by the user feedback after users try the recommended tracks. FilTrack is unique from the existing solutions in a way that it respects the privacy of the user when offering personalized suggestions by not storing any data. At the same time this approach allows the app to give better results by allowing users to try something new each time based on their current mood rather than showing the similar tracks the user always listens to based on their history like many other apps do.
